CBInfo Script - A Screenshot info script
---------------------------------
Prints your current Openbox, GTK, Icon and Font themes then takes a screenshot
after a 5 second delay. The screenshot is then saved to your home directory. 
The current config is setup for Crunchbang Openbox users,however the 
distribution, window manager and desktop environment can be changed by 
editing cbinfo.pl.

This script is provided with absolutely no warranty, by running this script you
acknowledge that it may blow up your computer, shave your dog, or wake your 
neighbors . If you modify this script I'd love to see what youv'e done. 
Feel free to email me at jinnstar@jinnfire.info.

I make no claims to be the original author of this script, I have made changes, 
updates and customizations to make it functional for the Crunchbang community.
